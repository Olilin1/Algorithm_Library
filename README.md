# Algorithm_Library

## About
This is library of common algorithms written in c++ that I have found to be useful in competitive programming. All algorithms implemented here have been implemented by myself, primarily for learning purposes. If you find them useful you are free to copy or use them however you wish, but there are probably better implementations out there.

The code in this repo has primarily been tested by online judges such as Kattis and Codeforces, and I make no claims about the correctness of the code. I am not responsible for any problems that may arise should you find yourself using my code.

## How to use
In order to use any of the algorithms in this library simply clone the repo, copy the files you need to your project directory, and then include them. Documentation for *most* of the algorithms can be found next to their definition.
